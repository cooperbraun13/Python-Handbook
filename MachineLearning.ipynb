    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning involves building mathematical models to help understand data\n",
    "* \"Learning\" enters the fray when we give these models _tunable parameters_ that can be adapted to observed data\n",
    "* Once these models have been fit to previously seen data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categories of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two main types: supervised and unsupervised learning\n",
    "* Supervised learning: models that can predict labels based on labeled training data\n",
    "    * Classification: models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories\n",
    "    * Regression: models that predict continuous labels\n",
    "* Unsupervised learning: models that identify structure in unlabeled data\n",
    "    * Clustering: models that detect and identify distinct groups in the data\n",
    "    * Dimenstionality reduction: models that detect and identify lower-dimensional structure in higher-dimensional data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Representation in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features matrix (X): Two-dimensional array with shape [n_samples, n_features]\n",
    "* Target array (y): One-dimensional array with length n_samples\n",
    "* Data typically stores in NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, or SciPy sparse matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scikit-Learn's Estimator API\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistency: Common interface for all algorithms\n",
    "* Inspection: Parameters exposed as public attributes\n",
    "* Composition: Complex tasks as sequences of simpler algorithms\n",
    "* Sensible defaults: Appropriate default parameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Steps for Using Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose model class: Import appropriate estimator (e.g., `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`)\n",
    "2. Choose hyperparameters: Instantiate model with desired settings\n",
    "3. Prepare data: Arrange into features matrix (X) and target vector (y)\n",
    "4. Fit model: Use `model.fit(X, y)` method\n",
    "5. Apply model\n",
    "    * For supervised learning: `model.predict(X_new)`\n",
    "    * For unsupervised learning: `model.transform(X) or model.predict(X)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Utility Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* `train_test_split()` - Divides data into training and testing sets\n",
    "* `accuracy_score()` - Measures prediction accuracy\n",
    "* `confusion_matrix()` - Shows detailed breakdown of correct/incorrect predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear Regression:**\n",
    "    * Model parameters stored with trailing underscores (e.g., model.coef_, model.intercept_)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classification** (e.g., Iris dataset with Gaussian Naive Bayes):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "      model = GaussianNB()\n",
    "      model.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)\n",
    "      y_model = model.predict(Xtest)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dimensionality Reduction** (e.g., PCA):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "      model = PCA(n_components=2)\n",
    "      model.fit(X)\n",
    "      X_2D = model.transform(X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering** (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Model):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "      model = GMM(n_components=3)\n",
    "      model.fit(X)\n",
    "      y_gmm = model.predict(X)\n",
    "```\n",
